# G2SO4
1) There is no particular order to the files, but to use some files you will see you may need to run first a code which contains the definitions of the unipotent and root subgroups of G2 (such as the code "matching"). Please do let us know if any part of those files are not easy to read/unclear. 
 
2) We have not made much comments on our lines of codes and computations, since we are expecting the reader is either familiarized with the definitions, or is following closely our paper "PARABOLICALLY INDUCED REPRESENTATIONS OF p-ADIC G2 DISTINGUISHED BY SO4 I" and/or that of Omer Offen "On parabolic induction associated with a p-adic symmetric space"

3) The second branch "old strategy" stores all files corresponding to an approach whose results were not satisfying, as explained in Appendix B of our paper

4) The word "matching" employed in the files' names refer to the process of matching the double coset representatives eta_i with Weyl group elements in the set W_b\W/W_b
5) The process of verifying the admissibility, openess and closedness of the orbits for each representative is done in "
admissibility_openess_closed"
6) We tried to verify those conditions using the corresponding "w" identified using the "matching" in the file "admissibility_with_w"
7) The file "tau_p213" refer to some technical condition given in the paper of Offen that we have verified (see the paper "PARABOLICALLY INDUCED REPRESENTATIONS OF p-ADIC G2 DISTINGUISHED BY SO4 I")
