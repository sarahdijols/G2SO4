# G2SO4
There is no particular order to the files, but to use some files you will see you may need to run first a code which contains the definitions of the unipotent subgroups of G2 (such as the code "matching"). 
We have not made much comments on our lines of codes and computations, since we are expecting the reader is either familiarized with the definitions, or is following closely our paper "PARABOLICALLY INDUCED REPRESENTATIONS OF p-ADIC G2 DISTINGUISHED BY SO4 I" and/or that of Omer Offen "On parabolic induction associated with a p-adic symmetric space"
